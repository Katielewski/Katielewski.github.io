title: Stylometry

 Day 2 of the program was dedicated to using digital resources to look at authorial style. As discussed in Day 1, programs like Voyant Tools use tokens of text to pick up on word patterns. These patterns of things such as average sentence length, most common stopwords, most common unique words, etc. can be used to create an authorial signature in a way. An author’s style is not simply their chosen words, but the smaller parts of syntax often lost to a human reader. However, a computer algorithm can recognize tedious and often unique trends in authorial writing styles in the way the author uses contractions or punctuation. The terms and practices of Stylometry have been around since the 1850s, just without computer algorithms to help. A person would do the job of physically counting and comparing word frequencies between texts, examining keywords words in their context, and looking at unique transcription patterns and abbreviations. 


As a class, we examined how stylometry programs function using the computer Language R and a template from the website Posit Could. We took a work of co-authorship and then selected a corpus of individual text samples from each author. The Posit Could program then creates a style package for each author and asses which parts of the co-authorship text fit which author’s trends presented in their package of work. Posit Cloud then spits out a color-coded diagram of its suspected authorship in a co-authored text. 


Then the whole class presented 3-5 sources from either a given genre or a given author and we asked the computer program to cluster based on style. I chose to examine the gene of epic poetry and again used The Iliad, Odyssey, and Aeneid. I also decided to add two other texts written by Vergil to see if the program would rather clump by author or genre. To my surprise, The Iliad, Aeneid, and two of Vergil's poems (the Eclogues and Georgics) were all sorted together but Homer's Odyssey was clumped way further with other authors selected by members of the class (seen below). It sparked a slew of questions for me: Why was it so far away? Did it have something to do with a change in style away from the other more war-driven texts? Was there a computer error? I think about how helpful this might be in looking at historical texts with rumored authorship or with matching fragments of text based on style (such as the ancient Greek poet Sappho whose fragmented text exists as well as many copycats claiming to be her by mimicking style).
