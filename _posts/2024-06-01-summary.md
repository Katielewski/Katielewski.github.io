title: Program Summary/Advice

The Digital Humanities Summer Institute is a unique and educational opportunity. Whether you have a concrete research project or are simply looking to explore humanities disciplines in the digital age (like myself) DHSI is a great place to gain practical skills and theoretical insight into the future of academia. I not only have the basic understanding to work with many computational computer tools but I am also left with questions to continue exploring such as "How and if AI should be used in the classroom?" and "Will computational tools increase the rate of confirmation bias among researchers?" 

The community aspect of DHSI was also incredibly welcoming and truly inspiring. Participants were encouraged to share their work with others, bounce around ideas, and collaborate on projects. Even though it was intimidating to be one of the few undergraduates in attendance at a conference where the other participants were graduate students, professors, librarians, and researchers, I quickly learned to accept this fact and use it to challenge myself and better understand how different professions approach the digital humanities. 

Thanks to the Center for the Humanities at Loyola University Maryland I was able to travel to a new country, immerse myself in a new field of study, meet and listen to lectures from accomplished professionals in humanities fields and beyond, and I was able to learn and grow as an academic. 

As far as I am concerned the program did not have any pressing flaws. The week ran smoothly, students participating were given structured and informational classes, as well as free time to explore a beautiful city! DHSI may be moving to Montreal next year, but that does not change that it is an excellent program run by passionate and smart educators who truly love what they are teaching and inspire students to feel the same.
