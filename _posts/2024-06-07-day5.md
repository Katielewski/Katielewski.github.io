 On the morning session of Day 5, we had time independently to work on a project of our choice. I messed around a bit more with the Recogito program from day 3 but never completed anything as it is a time-consuming task. I then switched to working with Cara to try and navigate Github.io (the site I used to write this final report). I also added my findings from the Day 4 Image analysis to the group slideshow that would be shared with all DHSI members at a reception. At said reception, I explored the work of other DHSI classes and was blown away by so much of the awesome collaborative work. A class on LGBTQ voices in the digital humanities called Queering DH worked on a project in which they asked Chat GPT AI to create the description and visuals of a trading card when prompted with an LGBTQ slang term. The cards provided an interesting perspective on how artificial intelligence must be trained when dealing with sensitive subjects, making sure it does not gather any training data from instances of hate speech. Learning what other classes had to share was inspiring and provided a unique perspective on all sorts of disciplines that use the Digital Humanities
