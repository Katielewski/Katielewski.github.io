I participated in Introduction to Computation for Literary Studies. As someone looking to study History, the class would provide me with insight into how to better interpret/analyze historical documents in a digital age. The class spaned roughly 4 full days with 2 three hour periods of class. Professor David Wrisley (a medievalist and DH professor at NYU Abu Dabi) led the class. The general structure was as follows. On day one we learned about text analysis and visualization using Voyant Tools. On day 2 we continued with Voyant tools and also took a look at Stylometry: Quantitative text analysis to determine authorial style. Day 3 was dedicated to geospatial mapping and how maps themselves can tell a comprehensive story. Day 4 was spent looking at network visualizations of texts Ie.) how many times characters interact with one another represented via character bubbles (nodes) and connecting lines (edges). The second half of day 4 and arguably my favorite lesson was spent looking at image analytics and photo clustering. Day 5 was a show and tell day in which we spent the morning working independently on a project and the afternoon viewing what others had accomplished throughout the week.
