I participated in Introduction to Computation for Literary Studies. As someone looking to study History, the class would provide me with insight into how to better interpret/analyze historical documents in a digital age. The class spaned roughly 4 full days with 2 three hour periods of class. Professor David Wrisley (a medievalist and DH professor at NYU Abu Dhabi) led the class. The general structure was as follows. On Day 1 we learned about text analysis and visualization using Voyant Tools: a free app for manipulating text-based data. On day 2 we continued with Voyant tools and were also introduced to the concept of Stylometry, a type of quantitative text analysis to determine an author's style. Day 3 was dedicated to geospatial mapping and how maps themselves can tell a comprehensive story. Day 4 was spent looking at network visualizations of text. i.e.) how many times characters interact with one another represented via character bubbles (nodes) and connecting lines (edges). The second half of day 4, and arguably my favorite lesson, was spent looking at image analytics and photo clustering. Day 5 was a show-and-tell day in which we spent the morning working independently on a project and used the afternoon to share what participants had learned and accomplished during the week.
