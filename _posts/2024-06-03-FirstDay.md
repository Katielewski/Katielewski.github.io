Introduction to Voyant Tools 


The day one session began with introductions from participants around the room. The 20-something-person class was filled with a diverse group of scholars. Some librarians, some literary researchers, some PHD/Masters students, some educators, and myself and Cara Lamina as the resident undergraduates. The class began by taking a look at the statement on the DHSI website: “A place for open digital scholarship” We then fell into a discussion about what it means to be a contributor to openness in the DH community. We landed on a few different meanings such as openness in a lack of ad blocking and payways to access data. Openness meaning easy navigation and a lack of complicated jargon in digital works. And lastly, openness in the process of creation of digital archives, websites, data sets, etc. This conversation while random sounding represented a huge part of the DHSI model. Digital scholarship is not meant to be an exclusive complicated process, but one that can be shared for the benefit of all.
