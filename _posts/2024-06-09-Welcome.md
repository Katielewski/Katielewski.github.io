From June 2nd to June 8th I participated in the Digital Humanites Summer Insitute at the University of Victoria British Columbia. Both myself and another participant from Loyola flew down two days early in order to do some sightseeing. We saw Humpback Whales, and the beautiful botanical gardens that were planted around a sulfer quarry! Once classes started we were focoused in and ready to learn and grow! 

The class I took was titled Introductiom to Computation for Literary Studies. This course was labled a foundations course meaning it would cover a lot of topics fairly quickly to give the students a comprehensive overview of avalible tools and partices for digital humanists
