From June 2nd to June 8th I participated in the Digital Humanities Summer Insitute at the University of Victoria British Columbia. Digital Humanities is an interdiciplinary form of study combining technology with non-STEM fields. The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library defines the Digital Humanities as a place "where the values of the humanities meet digital methods from fields such as software design, gaming, and mapping, leading to the implementation of digital humanities values: openness, experimentation, collaboration, connectedness, and diversity"  

The class I took was titled Introduction to Computation for Literary Studies. This course was labeled a foundations course meaning it would cover many topics fairly quickly to give the students a comprehensive overview of available tools and practices for digital humanists. 

Both myself and another participant from Loyola flew down two days early in order to do some sightseeing. We saw Humpback Whales, and the beautiful botanical gardens that were planted around a sulfer quarry! Once classes started we were focoused in and ready to learn and grow!


Whale Watching Fun!
